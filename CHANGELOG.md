### Migration Guide

✅ **No Breaking Changes**: Version 0.1.4 is fully backward compatible with 0.1.3.

```rust
// ✅ Existing synchronous code continues to work unchanged
let results = MarkdownHarvester::get_hyperlinks_content(text, http_config);

// 🚀 NEW: Asynchronous processing for better performance
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let callback = |url: Option<String>, content: Option<String>| async move {
        if let (Some(url), Some(content)) = (url, content) {
            println!("Processed: {} ({} chars)", url, content.len());
        }
    };
    
    MarkdownHarvester::get_hyperlinks_content_async(text, http_config, callback).await?;
}
```

### Performance Comparison
| Mode | Processing Time | Use Case |
|------|----------------|----------|
| **Synchronous** | Sequential processing | Returns all results after all URLs complete |
| **Asynchronous** | Parallel processing | Streams results as each URL completes |

### When to Use Async vs Sync
- **🔄 Use Synchronous** for:
  - When you need all results collected before proceeding
  - Simple applications or quick prototypes
  - Educational purposes and straightforward workflows
  - When you don't need streaming results

- **⚡ Use Asynchronous** for:
  - Real-time result processing as URLs complete
  - High-performance applications requiring maximum throughput
  - Integration with existing async/await codebases
  - When you want to process results incrementally
  - Memory-efficient streaming of large result sets

### Migration Guide

⚠️ **Important**: This is a breaking change. All existing code must be updated.

```rust
// ❌ Before v0.1.3 - OLD API (will not compile)
let results = MarkdownHarvester::get_hyperlinks_content(text);

// ✅ v0.1.3 - NEW API with default configuration
let results = MarkdownHarvester::get_hyperlinks_content(text, HttpConfig::default());

// ✅ v0.1.3 - NEW API with custom timeout
let config = HttpConfig::builder().timeout(5000).build();
let results = MarkdownHarvester::get_hyperlinks_content(text, config);

// ✅ v0.1.3 - NEW API with full configuration
let config = HttpConfig::builder()
    .timeout(10000)           // 10 second timeout
    .max_redirect(5)          // Allow up to 5 redirects
    .cookie_store(true)       // Enable cookie storage
    .build();
let results = MarkdownHarvester::get_hyperlinks_content(text, config);
```

### Why This Breaking Change?
This breaking change was necessary to:
1. **🚀 Enable Future Extensibility**: The new architecture allows adding HTTP features without further breaking changes
2. **🎯 Improve Flexibility**: Users can now configure timeouts, redirects, cookies, and future HTTP options
3. **🏗️ Better API Design**: Builder pattern provides a more intuitive and discoverable API
4. **📈 Enhanced Functionality**: Support for advanced HTTP features that weren't possible with the old API

## [0.1.2] - 2025-01-11

### Added
- **HttpClient** component: Responsible for HTTP requests and URL processing
  - Extracts URLs from text using regex patterns
  - Handles HTTP requests with random user agent rotation
  - Can be used independently for HTTP-based content retrieval
- **ContentProcessor** component: Responsible for HTML cleaning and Markdown conversion
  - Parses HTML and extracts content from body elements
  - Removes unwanted elements (scripts, ads, navigation)
  - Converts cleaned HTML to Markdown format
  - Can be used independently for HTML-to-Markdown conversion
- **MarkdownHarvester** component: Provides unified interface combining both components
  - Encapsulates the complexity of coordinating HTTP and content processing
  - Implements the Facade pattern for clean API access
- Comprehensive unit tests for all new components
- Individual component testing for isolated functionality
- Integration tests for component interaction

### Changed
- Separated responsibilities into independent components
  - `MarkdownHarvester` now acts as a facade to maintain backward compatibility
  - Internal implementation now uses `HttpClient` and `ContentProcessor` components
  - All existing public APIs remain unchanged for backward compatibility

### Technical Details
- Implemented separation of concerns following the Facade pattern
- HTTP logic isolated in `HttpClient` component
- Content processing logic isolated in `ContentProcessor` component

### Migration
No migration required. This version maintains full backward compatibility with v0.1.1.
The `MarkdownHarvester::get_hyperlinks_content()` function continues to work exactly as before.

For new projects, you can now use the individual components:
```rust
use markdown_harvest::{HttpClient, ContentProcessor, MarkdownHarvester};

// Use components individually
let http_client = HttpClient::new();
let content_processor = ContentProcessor::new();

// Or use the facade
let results = MarkdownHarvester::get_hyperlinks_content(text);
```
