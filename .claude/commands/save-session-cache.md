# Cache Project Context

I'll analyze and remember key information about this Markdown Harvest Rust project to speed up future commands.

I'll detect and remember:

    Cargo build configuration and dependencies
    How to run tests (cargo test)
    What formatter is configured (rustfmt)
    Project structure and components (MarkdownHarvester, HttpClient, ContentProcessor, etc.)
    Key features (sync/async processing, URL extraction, HTML to Markdown conversion)
    Test coverage (36+ unit tests with async functionality)
    CLI interactive mode availability
    Version 0.1.4 with async processing support

This helps other commands run faster by not re-analyzing the same information repeatedly.
